Introduction {#intro}
============

C and C++ diverge in their definition of forward progress guarantees, and have done so since C++11 and C11 added a memory model and acknowledged that threads exist. Both committees have been working together to reduce needless differences. [[P2735r0]] and [[N2644]] perform such harmonization.

C does not make iteration statements whose controlling expression is a constant expression Undefined Behavior, whereas C++ does. C++ implementations therefore assume that even "trivial" infinite loops must terminate.

This is unfortunate because using an infinite loop is a common idiom in low-level programming, particularly when a bare-metal system or kernel must halt progress. It would be easy for programmers to satisfy the C++ requirements on infinite loops, and it would be easy for compilers to diagnose "invalid" infinite loops. Neither programmers nor implementations have done so. Instead, programmers decry C++'s obtuseness, and implementations upset developers by optimizing away their infinite loops (marking them as unreachable, leading to surrounding code being optimized away).

For example, this code prints `Hello, World!` in recent versions of clang (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/d1WP4KP99">see example</a>):

<xmp>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  while (true)
    ; 
}

void unreachable() {
  std::cout << "Hello world!" << std::endl;
}
</xmp>

It is easy for the C++ Standards Committee to instead align with C, and allow "trivial" infinite loops as C does. However, care must be taken when doing so. C++ has good reasons to specify that infinite loops are undefined behavior: it is desirable to express forward progress guarantees in a programming language because it unlocks a design space in concurrency and parallelism software and hardware design. An 80 minute deep-dive in this topic is available in [[ForwardProgress]]. A definition of "trivial" which continues supporting this design space is important to reach.

Other programming languages, compilers, and hardware explicitly or de-facto rely on the C++ specification of its abstract machine, including the behavior infinite loops. Some by borrowing from C++'s specification, others by simply using compilers that implement C++ as their optimizer (see [[LLVMProgressDiscussion]], and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/28728">a Rust bug of this shape</a>), and yet others by being designed around C++ programs. It is therefore likely that a broader specification for an abstract machine, outside of C++, is needed to truly resolve problems as those tackled in this paper.

Revision 3 {#r3}
----------

P2809r3 considers the freestanding behavior, and applies wording changes on the language side to follow CWG guidance. It was seen and approved by LEWG.

However, CWG suggested changes which then removed the need for `std::this_thread::yield_forever()`, making LEWG moot.


Standards {#pedantry}
=========

C++ Standard {#cpp}
------------

Since C++11, the Standard's forward progress guarantees have been defined in **[intro.progress]** as follows:

<blockquote>
  The implementation may assume that any thread will eventually do one of the following:

  * terminate,
  * make a call to a library I/O function,
  * perform an access through a `volatile` glvalue, or
  * perform a synchronization operation or an atomic operation.

  [*Note:* This is intended to allow compiler transformations such as removal of empty loops, even when termination cannot be proven. —*end note*]
</blockquote>

This forward progress guarantee applies to the following iteration statements:

<blockquote>
    `while` `(` *condition* `)` *statement*<br>
    `do` *statement* `while` `(` *expression* `)` `;`<br>
    `for` `(` *init-statement* *condition*<sub>*opt*</sub> `;` *expression*<sub>*opt*</sub> `)` *statement*<br>
    `for` `(` *init-statement*<sub>*opt*</sub> *for-range-declaration* `:` *for-range-initializer* `)` *statement*<br>
</blockquote>

C Standard {#c}
----------

Since C11, the Standard's forward progress guarantees have been defined in **Iteration statements** (section 6.8.5 of C17) as follows:

<blockquote>
  An iteration statement may be assumed by the implementation to terminate if its controlling expression is not a constant expression<sup>†</sup>, and none of the following operations are performed in its body, controlling expression or (in the case of a `for` statement) its *expression-3*<sup>‡</sup>:

  * input/output operations
  * accessing a `volatile` object
  * synchronization or atomic operations.

  <sup>†</sup> An omitted controlling expression is replaced by a nonzero constant, which is a constant expression.

  <sup>‡</sup> This is intended to allow compiler transformations such as removal of empty loops even when termination cannot be proven.
</blockquote>

This forward progress guarantee applies to the following iteration statements:

<blockquote>
    `while` `(` *expression* `)` *statement*<br>
    `do` *statement* `while` `(` *expression* `)` `;`<br>
    `for` `(` *expression*<sub>*opt*</sub> `;` *expression*<sub>*opt*</sub> `;` *expression*<sub>*opt*</sub> `)` *statement*<br>
    `for` `(` *declaration* *expression*<sub>*opt*</sub> `;` *expression*<sub>*opt*</sub> `)` *statement*<br>
</blockquote>

By omission, iteration statements are undefined if the controlling expression does not meet the criteria above.

Freestanding in C++ {#freebird}
-------------------

Freestanding implementations aren't given the same guarantees. Indeed, **[intro.multithread.general]** states:

<blockquote>
   Under a hosted implementation, a C++ program can have more than one thread running concurrently.
</blockquote>

Which means that a freestanding implementation can have no threads running concurrently.

Combined with **[intro.progress]**:

<blockquote>
  For a thread of execution providing *concurrent forward progress guarantees*, the implementation ensures that the thread will eventually make progress for as long as it has not terminated.
</blockquote>

We conclude that freestanding implementations can decide to loosen forward progress guarantees.


History {#yawn}
=======

C99 6.8.5p4 states:

<blockquote>
  An iteration statement causes a statement called the loop body to be executed repeatedly until the controlling expression compares equal to `0`.
</blockquote>

C99 therefore disallows compilers from assuming that loops will eventually terminate.

C++11 added a full memory model to C++, allowing C++ to speak of threads and inter-thread communications in a useful manner. This forward progress guarantee does away with the C99 guarantee above. A key to concurrency and parallelism is understanding when forward progress is guaranteed, because without forward progress some concurrent and parallel algorithms do not work. For example, a pair of producer / consumer threads will never consume data if the producer does not have forward progress.

This memory model work was imported into the C11 standard through [[N1349]]. There were discussions on the topic of forward progress:

* [[N1509]] proposed eliminating the paragraph on forward progress from C1X.
* [[N1528]] responded to N1509, explaining the C1X wording.

These two papers were discussed, and WG14 took the following decision:

<blockquote>
  **ACTION** Douglas to work with Larry to come up with the proposed words are:

  Change 6.8.5p6 as follows:
  
  <blockquote>
    An iteration statement whose controlling expression is not a constant expression (or omitted), that performs no input/output operations, does not access `volatile` objects, and performs no synchronization or atomic operations in its body, controlling expression, or (in the case of a `for` statement) its *expressionX3*, may be assumed by the implementation to terminate.
  </blockquote>

  **Decision:**  Adopt N1509, as modified above, to the C1X WP. result: 14 favor, 0 neutral, 1 against
</blockquote>


Rationale {#why}
=========

The forward progress guarantees were added to C++11 and C11 along with a memory model. This addition of forward progress guarantees reflected existing practice in compilers, and did not simply serve concurrency and parallelism goals. Indeed, compilers had been assuming that loops can terminate to enable optimizations that transform loops and reorder store instructions and other side-effects. Proving that loops terminate is generally equivalent to solving the halting problem. The compilers were therefore disregarding the C99 wording which said that loops terminate when their controlling expression becomes `0`, and were therefore non-conformant.

The standards added the forward progress guarantees to change an optimization problem from "solve the halting problem" to "there will be observable side effects in the forms of termination, I/O, `volatile`, and/or atomic synchronization, any other operation can be reordered". The former is generally impossible to solve, whereas the latter is eminently tractable.

Forward progress guarantees therefore helped program concurrency and parallelism, and standardized existing practice which unlocked performance in compiler optimizations.

However, developers do sometimes rely on infinite loops, for valid reasons. When they do so, the loops have controlling expressions which are constant expressions. Such controlling expressions are known at compile-time by definition, and are therefore easy for a compiler to detect, and mark a loop as not open to optimizations which assume termination.

That said, an issue arises with the current wording in C, because this loop:

```
while (cond) {
  // ...
}
```

is not equivalent to that loop:

```
while (true) {
  if (!cond)
    break;
  // ...
}
```

Because its controlling expression is not a constant expression. This difference is surprising because the loops look syntactically equivalent. The same applies for any loop which has a constant expression controlling expression that converts to `true`, and has a `return`, `longjmp`, or (potentially nested) `throw`.

We could conside a change such as adding an implicit `std::this_thread::yield()` to all loops whose controlling expression is a constant expression, but doing so would needlessly pessimize code. This pessimization would likely be measured in multiples for GPU code. Indeed, without the `yield` some GPU hardware would `yield_forever` forward progress on *all* warps in a thread block if one of the warps were to have an infinite loop. This behavior is acceptable while infinite loops are undefined behavior, but pessimizes loops which aren't infinite (and therefore don't exhibit forward progress issues).

The approach with `yield` also causes problems pertaining to code motion: a compiler is no longer allowed to hoist code from below a loops whose controlling expression is a constant expression to above it, nor merge loops whose whose controlling expression is a constant expression. This is also a pessimization which affects more than "trivial" infinite loops.

A change is therefore required which does not match the C semantics, and C would then need to be updated to match. It should be pointed out that C technically does not have forward progress guarantees, but hints at maybe having some guarantees, thefore changes to C ought to consider also adding forward progress guarantees.

The proposed wording captures very narrowly a few forms of infinite loops and makes them equivalent to a repeated call to `std::this_thread::yield();`. This behavior is implementation-defined in freestanding implementations, because some freestanding implementations do not offer forward progress guarantees and require explicit cooperation, adding a call to `yield` would therefore add cooperation where none was intended. By doing so, the proposal does not pessimize certain types of loops as C does, and continues to allow an implementation to assume that most loops will terminate.

The proposed wording also adds to the list of allowed assumptions that a `[[noreturn]]` function or `std::this_thread::yield()` will be called. They were a missing form of valid non-forward-progress in threads that was discovered while discussing this paper in SG1.

This paper does not affect other forms of backwards control flow such as `goto`, `setjmp`/`longjmp`, infinite tail recursion, nor looping with signal handlers. While they are also forms of loops, infinite versions of them are not idiomatic in C and C++. Functional programmers might be upset at this fact.

CWG pointed out that some loops might be infinite at compile-time but not runtime, and felt very good about themselves. Such code is ill-formed were it executed at compile-time, but the proposed transformation initially inadvertently made them well-formed. One example of this would be in implementations where floating-point behavior differs between compile-time and runtime environments. Another comes in with cases such as:

<pre><code>
  int x = 42;
  while (std::is_constant_evaluated() || --x) ;
</code></pre>

The objective of this paper was to make *trivial* infinite loops not become undefined behavior. Code as above has probably never been written by anyone, ever, before this paper's publication. It is certainly not useful, besides its use as a way to show off one's appreciation of minutia. That said, the change proposed in this paper has a sensible outcome for this horrendous code: the loop will now have an implicit call to `yield` at runtime.


Language Wording {#lang-word}
================

Modify **[stmt.iter.general]**, adding the following paragraph at its end:

<blockquote>
  8.6.1 General
  <br>
  [...]
  <br>
  <ins>A *trivially empty iteration statement* is an iteration statement matching one of the following forms:</ins>
  <br>
  
  * <ins>`while` `(` *expression* `)` `;`</ins>
  * <ins>`while` `(` *expression* `)` `{ }`</ins>
  * <ins>`do` `;` `while` `(` *expression* `)` `;`</ins>
  * <ins>`do` `{ }` `while` `(` *expression* `)` `;`</ins>
  * <ins>`for` `(` *init-statement* *expression*<sub>*opt*</sub> `;` `)` `;`</ins>
  * <ins>`for` `(` *init-statement* *expression*<sub>*opt*</sub> `;` `)` `{ }`</ins>
  
  <ins>The *controlling expression* of a trivially empty iteration statement is the *expression* of a `while`, `do`, or `for` statement (or `true`, if the `for` statement has no *expression*).</ins>
  <br>
  <ins>A *trivial infinite loop* is a trivially empty iteration statement for which the converted controlling expression, when interpreted as a *constant-expression*, evaluates to `true`.</ins>
  <br>
  <ins>The *statement* of a trivial infinite loop is replaced with a call to `std::this_thread::yield`; it is implementation-defined whether this replacement occurs on freestanding implementations.</ins>
  <br>
  <ins>[*Note:* In a freestanding environment, concurrent forward progress is not guaranteed; such systems therefore require explicit cooperation. The behavior of trivial infinite loops is therefore implementation-defined because a call to `yield` would add implicit cooperation where none was otherwise intended. —*end note*]</ins>

</blockquote>

Modify **[intro.progress]** as follows:

<blockquote>
  The implementation may assume that any thread will eventually do one of the following:

  * terminate,
  * <ins>invoke `std::this_thread::yield()`,</ins>
  * make a call to a library I/O function,
  * perform an access through a `volatile` glvalue,<del> or</del>
  * perform a synchronization operation or an atomic operation<del>.</del><ins>, or</ins>
  * <ins>continue execution of a trivial infinite loop (**[stmt.iter.general**]).</ins>

  [*Note:* This is intended to allow compiler transformations such as removal<ins>, merging, and reordering</ins> of empty loops, even when termination cannot be proven. <ins>An affordance is made for trivial infinite loops, which cannot be removed nor reordered.</ins> —*end note*]
  
</blockquote>

Alternative {#alt}
===========

Alternative Language Wording {#lang-alt}
----------------------------

Per EWG discussion in [[#r2]], this is not the preferred option, [[#lang-word]] is preferred.

Modify **[intro.progress]** as follows:

<blockquote>
  The implementation may assume that any thread will eventually do one of the following:

  * terminate,
  * <ins>call a function marked `[[noreturn]]`,</ins>
  * <ins>call `std::this_thread::yield()`,</ins>
  * make a call to a library I/O function,
  * perform an access through a `volatile` glvalue, or
  * perform a synchronization operation or an atomic operation.

  [*Note:* This is intended to allow compiler transformations such as removal<ins>, merging, and reordering</ins> of empty loops, even when termination cannot be proven. —*end note*]
  
  <ins>  
  Notwithstanding the above, the implementation shall implement an iteration statement (*[stmt.iter]*) as equivalent to a call to `std::this_thread::yield_forever()` if:
  </ins>

  <ins>

  * the iteration statement, nor any of the subexpresssions (*[intro.execution]*), do not enclose an access through a `volatile` glvalue, nor a synchronization operation or an atomic operation, and
  * the iteration statement's controlling expression is a converted constant expression (*[expr.const]*) that converts to `true`, where the controlling expression is the *condition* of a `while` or `for` statement, or the `expression` of a `do` statement, and
  * the iteration statement encloses none of:

    * a top-level `break` statement (*[stmt.break]*),
    * a `goto` statement (*[stmt.goto]*) whose label (*[stmt.label]*) is located outside of the iteration statement's substatement,
    * a `return` statement (*[stmt.return]*),
    * a `co_return` statement (*[stmt.return.coroutine]*),
    * a `co_await` expression (*[expr.await]*),
    * a `co_yield` expression (*[expr.yield]*),
    * a potentially-throwing expression (*[except.spec]*), and
    * a function call (*[expr.call]*).

  </ins>
  
  <ins>It is implementation-defined whether a program in a freestanding environment is required to implement the above behavior of iteration statements.</ins>
  <br>
  <ins>[*Note:* This is intended to allow programmers to use idiomatic trivial infinite loops without these loops being undefined behavior per the above. —*end note*]</ins>
  <br>
  <ins>[*Note:* In a freestanding environment, concurrent forward progress is not guaranteed. An implementation is encouraged to match the behavior of potentially infinite iteration statements with its implementation-defined concurrent behavior. A freestanding environment which implements `std::yield` is encouraged to also provide `std::yield_forever`, and is encouraged to offer the behavior described above. —*end note*]</ins>

</blockquote>


Alternative Library Wording {#lib-alt}
---------------------------

Per CWG discussion in [[#r3]], this library change is not proposed. It was originally proposed along with [[#lang-alt]].

Modify **[thread.threads]** as follows:

<blockquote>
[thread.threads] describes components that can be used to create and manage threads.

  <pre><code>
  namespace std {

    // ...

    // [thread.thread.this], namespace this_thread
    namespace this_thread {
      thread::id get_id() noexcept;

      void yield() noexcept;
      <ins>
      [[noreturn]] void yield_forever() noexcept;
      </ins>
      template&lt;class Clock, class Duration&gt;
        void sleep_until(const chrono::time_point&lt;Clock, Duration&gt;& abs_time);
      template&lt;class Rep, class Period&gt;
        void sleep_for(const chrono::duration&lt;Rep, Period&gt;& rel_time);
    }

  }
  </code></pre>
</blockquote>

Add a paragraph to section **[thread.thread.this]** as follows:

<blockquote>

  <pre><code>
    <ins>
      [[noreturn]] void yield_forever() noexcept;
    </ins>
  </code></pre>

  <ins>*Effects*: Equivalent to:</ins>
  <pre><code>
  <ins>while (true)</ins>
    <ins>std::this_thread::yield();</ins>
  </code></pre>

    <ins>*Recommended practice:* A freestanding environment which implements `std::this_thread::yield` should also provide `std::this_thread::yield_forever`.</ins>
