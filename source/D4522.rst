---------
Rationale
---------

Fences allow programmers to express a conservative approximation to the precise
pair-wise relations of operations required to be ordered in the happens-before
relation. This is conservative because fences use the sequenced-before relation
to select vast extents of the program into the happens-before relation. That
makes it easy to over-constrain the order of memory operations in the
implementation of synchronization primitives that use more than a single atomic
memory location.

The flush primitive of OpenMP is more expressive than the fences of C++11 and
C++14 in at least one sense: it can optionally restrict the memory operations to
a user-specified set of memory locations. This is often enough for short
lock-free algorithms to exactly express the required pair-wise ordering. This
capability isn't only relevant in OpenMP and isn't only to the benefit of the
compiler, but also in expert hands it can unlock the maximum memory performance
out of all popular hardware platforms.

An example of this optimization can be seen in a likely implementation of
N4392_'s ``std::barrier`` object. This algorithm makes ordered modifications on
the atomic objects of a larger non-atomic synchronization object, but the
internal modifications need only be ordered with respect to each other, not all
surrounding objects.

.. _N4392: http://wg21.link/N4392

``barrier`` is currently implemented as:

.. code-block:: c++

  struct barrier {
      // Some member functions elided.
      void arrive_and_wait() {
          int const myepoch = epoch.load(memory_order_relaxed);
          int const result = arrived.fetch_add(1, memory_order_acq_rel) + 1;
          if (result == expected) {
              expected = nexpected.load(memory_order_relaxed);
              arrived.store(0, memory_order_relaxed);
              // Only need to order {expected, arrived} -> {epoch}.
              epoch.store(myepoch + 1, memory_order_release);
          }
          else
              while (epoch.load(memory_order_acquire) == myepoch)
                  ;
      }
  private:
      int expected;
      atomic<int> arrived, nexpected, epoch;
  };

The release operation on the epoch atomic is likely to require the compiler to
insert a fence that has an effect that goes beyond the intended constraint,
which is to order only the operations on the barrier object. Since the barrier
object is likely to be smaller than a cache line and the library's
implementation can control its alignment using ``alignas``, then it would be
possible to compile this program without a fence in this location on
architectures that are cache-line coherent. To concisely express the bound on
the set of memory operations whose order is constrained, we propose to accompany
``std::atomic_thread_fence`` with an ``object`` variant which takes a reference
to the object(s) to be ordered by the fence.

-----------------
Proposed addition
-----------------

Under 29.2 Header ``<atomic>`` synopsis [**atomics.syn**]:

.. code-block:: c++

  namespace std {
     // 29.8, fences
     // ...
     template<class... T>
     void atomic_object_fence(memory_order, T&&... objects) noexcept;
   }

Under 29.8 Fences [**atomics.fences**], after the current
``atomic_thread_fence`` paragraph:

``template<class... T> void atomic_object_fence(memory_order, T&&... objects) noexcept;``

*Effect*: Equivalent to ``atomic_thread_fence(order)`` except that operations on
objects other than those in the variadic template arguments and their are
*un-sequenced* with the fence.

*Note*: The compiler may omit fences entirely depending on alignment
information, may generate a dynamic test leading to a fence for under-aligned
objects, or may emit the same fence an ``atomic_thread_fence`` would.

The ``__cpp_lib_atomic_object_fence`` feature test macro should be added.

----------------------
Implementation details
----------------------

A trivially conforming implementation may implement the new overload in terms of
the existing ``std::atomic_thread_fence`` using the same memory order:

.. code-block:: c++

     template<class... T>
     void atomic_object_fence(std::memory_order order, T &&...) noexcept {
       std::atomic_thread_fence(order);
     }

A more advanced conforming implementation may specialize the single-object case
on architectures or micro-architectures that are cache-line coherent:

.. code-block:: c++

     #define __CACHE_LINE_SIZE // Secret (micro-)architectural value.
     template <class T>
     std::enable_if_t<std::is_standard_layout<T>::value &&
                      __CACHE_LINE_SIZE - alignof(T) % __CACHE_LINE_SIZE >=
                          sizeof(T)>
     atomic_object_fence(std::memory_order, T &&object) noexcept {
       asm volatile("" : "+m"(object) : "m"(object));  // Code motion barrier.
     }

For multiple objects, an implementation for the same architecture may emit a
run-time check that the total footprint of all the objects fits in the span of a
single cache line.  This check may commonly be eliminated as dead code.

The above barrier example's inner-code would use the new overload as follows:

.. code-block:: c++

          if (result == expected) {
              expected = nexpected.load(memory_order_relaxed);
              arrived.store(0, memory_order_relaxed);
	      atomic_object_fence(memory_order_release, *this);
              epoch.store(myepoch + 1, memory_order_relaxed);
          }

The rewrite could also list individual members of ``barrier`` instead of
``*this``. Both rewrites would be equivalent.

A non-trivial implementation enables hardware-specific optimizations which
cannot be expressed in C++ today. If the synchronized object(s) are known to
reside in memory that's not visible to other threads of execution, then a weaker
type of fence than the hardware's global fence can be used.

A sophisticated implementation based on a virtual ISA may include a memory
barrier that is applied to a sized region of memory.  Thus it can convey to the
hardware nearly the full precision of the C++ primitive proposed here.

Memory model example
--------------------

=========================== ===========================
T0                          T1
=========================== ===========================
``0: w = 1;``               ``4: while(!a.load(rlx));``
``1: x = 1;``               ``5: objfence(acq, a, x);``
``2: objfence(rel, a, x);`` ``6: assert(x);``
``3: a.store(1,rlx);``      ``7: assert(w);``
=========================== ===========================

``2`` synchronizes-with ``5`` because [**29.8¶2**]:
  A. ``2`` is sequenced-before ``3``,
  B. ``3`` inter-thread happens-before ``4``, and
  C. ``4`` is sequenced-before ``5``.

``1`` happens-before ``6`` because [**1.10¶13-14**]:
  A. ``1`` is sequenced-before ``2``,
  B. ``2`` synchronizes-with ``5``, and
  C. ``5`` is sequenced-before ``6``.

Therefore ``assert(x)`` of ``6`` does not fire.

``0`` has a data-race with ``7`` because [**1.10¶23**]:
  A. ``0`` is not sequenced-before ``2``, or
  B. ``5`` is not sequenced-before ``7``.

Therefore ``0`` does not happen-before ``7``, nor the reverse, and the
``assert(w)`` of ``7`` makes the program undefined due to a data-race. This is
true because operations on ``w`` are unsequenced with any object.
