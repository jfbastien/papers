---------
Rationale
---------

Starting with C++11, the library includes
``std::thread::hardware_concurrency()`` to provide an implementation quantity
useful in the design of control structures in multi-threaded programs: the
extent of threads that do not interfere (to the first-order). Established
practice throughout the industry also relies on a second implementation
quantity, used instead in the design of data structures in the same programs.
This quantity is the granularity of memory that does not interfere (to the
first-order), commonly referred to as the *cache-line size*.

Uses of *cache-line size* fall into two broad categories:

* Avoiding destructive interference (false-sharing) between objects with
  temporally disjoint runtime access patterns from different
  threads. e.g. Producer-consumer queues.
* Promoting constructive interference (true-sharing) between objects which have
  temporally local runtime access patterns. e.g. The ``barrier`` example, as
  illustrated in P0153R0_.

.. _P0153R0: http://wg21.link/P0153R0

The most sigificant issue with this useful implementation quantity is the
questionable portability of the methods used in current practice to determine
its value, despite their pervasiveness and popularity as a group. In the
appendix_ we review several different compile-time and run-time methods. The
portability problem with most of these methods is that they expose a
micro-architectural detail without accounting for the intent of the implementors
(such as we are) over the life of the ISA or ABI.

We aim to contribute a modest invention for this cause, abstractions for this
quantity that can be conservatively defined for given purposes by
implementations:

* *Destructive interference size*: a number that's suitable as an offset between
  two objects to likely avoid false-sharing due to different runtime access
  patterns from different threads.
* *Constructive interference size*: a number that's suitable as a limit on two
  objects' combined memory footprint size and base alignment to likely promote
  true-sharing between them.

In both cases these values are provided on a quality of implementation basis,
purely as hints that are likely to improve performance. These are ideal portable
values to use with the ``alignas()`` keyword, for which there currently exists
nearly no standard-supported portable uses.

-----------------
Proposed addition
-----------------

Below, substitute the `�` character with a number the editor finds appropriate
for the sub-section. We propose adding the following to the standard:

Under 18.6 Header ``<new>`` synopsis [**support.dynamic**]:

.. code-block:: c++

  namespace std {
    // ...
    // 18.6.� Hardware interference size
    static constexpr size_t hardware_destructive_interference_size = implementation-defined;
    static constexpr size_t hardware_constructive_interference_size = implementation-defined;
    // ...
  }

Under 18.6.� Hardware interference size [**hardware.interference**]:

``constexpr size_t hardware_destructive_interference_size = implementation-defined;``

This number is the minimum recommended offset between two concurrently-accessed
objects to avoid additional performance degradation due to contention introduced
by the implementation. It shall be at least ``alignof(std::max_align_t)``.

[*Example:*

.. code-block:: c++

  struct not_the_same {
    alignas(hardware_destructive_interference_size) atomic<int> cat;
    alignas(hardware_destructive_interference_size) atomic<int> dog;
  };

— *end example*]

``constexpr size_t hardware_constructive_interference_size = implementation-defined;``

This number is the minimum recommended alignment of contiguous memory occupied
by two objects accessed with temporal locality by concurrent threads. It shall
be at least ``alignof(std::max_align_t)``.

[*Note:* This number is also the maximum recommended size of contiguous memory
occupied by two objects accessed in this manner. — *end note*]

[*Example:*

.. code-block:: c++

  struct together {
    atomic<int> dog;
    int puppy;
  };
  struct venery {
    // Other data members...
    alignas(sizeof(together)) together pack;
    // Other data members...
  };
  static_assert(sizeof(together) <= hardware_constructive_interference_size);

— *end example*]

The ``__cpp_lib_thread_hardware_interference_size`` feature test macro should be
added.

Compile-time *cache-line size*
==============================

We informatively list a few ways in which the L1 *cache-line size* is obtained
in different open-source projects at compile-time.

The Linux kernel defines the ``__cacheline_aligned`` macro which is configured
for each architecture through ``L1_CACHE_BYTES``. On some architectures this
value is determined through the configure-time option
``CONFIG_<ARCH>_L1_CACHE_SHIFT``, and on others the value of ``L1_CACHE_SHIFT``
is hard-coded in the architecture's ``include/asm/cache.h`` header.

Many open-source projects from Google contain a ``base/port.h`` header which
defines the ``CACHELINE_ALIGNED`` macro based on an explicit list of
architecture detection macros. These header files have often diverged. A token
example from the autofdo_ project is:

.. _autofdo: https://github.com/google/autofdo/blob/master/base/port.h

.. code-block:: c++

  // Cache line alignment
  #if defined(__i386__) || defined(__x86_64__)
  #define CACHELINE_SIZE 64
  #elif defined(__powerpc64__)
  // TODO(dougkwan) This is the L1 D-cache line size of our Power7 machines.
  // Need to check if this is appropriate for other PowerPC64 systems.
  #define CACHELINE_SIZE 128
  #elif defined(__arm__)
  // Cache line sizes for ARM: These values are not strictly correct since
  // cache line sizes depend on implementations, not architectures.  There
  // are even implementations with cache line sizes configurable at boot
  // time.
  #if defined(__ARM_ARCH_5T__)
  #define CACHELINE_SIZE 32
  #elif defined(__ARM_ARCH_7A__)
  #define CACHELINE_SIZE 64
  #endif
  #endif

  #ifndef CACHELINE_SIZE
  // A reasonable default guess.  Note that overestimates tend to waste more
  // space, while underestimates tend to waste more time.
  #define CACHELINE_SIZE 64
  #endif

  #define CACHELINE_ALIGNED __attribute__((aligned(CACHELINE_SIZE)))

Runtime *cache-line size*
=========================

We informatively list a few ways in which the L1 *cache-line size* can be
obtained on different operating systems and architectures at runtime. Libraries
such as hwloc_ perform these queries, and could also be added to the standard as
a separate proposal.

.. _hwloc: http://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc/

On OSX one would use:

.. code-block:: c++

  sysctlbyname("hw.cachelinesize", &cacheline_size, &sizeof_cacheline_size, 0, 0)

On Windows one would use:

.. code-block:: c++

  GetLogicalProcessorInformation(&buf[0], &sizeof_buf);
  for (i = 0; i != sizeof_buf / sizeof(SYSTEM_LOGICAL_PROCESSOR_INFORMATION); ++i) {
    if (buf[i].Relationship == RelationCache && buf[i].Cache.Level == 1)
      cacheline_size = buf[i].Cache.LineSize;

On Linux one would either use:

.. code-block:: c++

  p = fopen("/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cache/index0/coherency_line_size", "r");
  fscanf(p, "%d", &cacheline_size);

or:

.. code-block:: c++

  sysconf(_SC_LEVEL1_DCACHE_LINESIZE);

On x86 one would use the ``CPUID`` Instruction with ``EAX = 80000005h``, which
leaves the result in ``ECX``, which needs further work to extract.

On ARM one would use ``mrs %[ctr], ctr_el0``, which needs further work to
extract.
